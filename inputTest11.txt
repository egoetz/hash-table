DEAR HOLMES
I AM MOST CONVINCED THAT YOU ARE QUITE ILL
AND IMPLORE YOU TO CEASE SNEAKING OUT IN THE COLD AT ONCE
IT IS CERTAINLY THE CAUSE OF YOUR COUGH
PLEASE CONSIDER YOUR GOOD HEALTH
SINCERELY WATSON
PS I HAVE RECENTLY READ THE STRANGEST OF TIMES IN THE TIMES. LOOK AT
PAGE A10 FOR AN AD ENTITLED MISSING PICTURE IT SHOULD
KEEP YOU WARM AND YOUR MIND ENGAGED
